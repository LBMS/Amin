				Students who are blind or visually impaired can benefit from involvement in dance. Dance can improve students movement, coordination, independence and can also help the student increase their orientation and mobility skills. The student may have opportunities to participate in dance within the Physical Education program, or may choose to take formal dance lessons.
				<li>Students with low vision may need physical guidance or access to a dance instructor's movements. To do this, the student may need to be in close proximity to the instructor. Students who are blind will need to initially be motored through the movements. To do this, allow the student to place their hands on the teacher to understand the movement.
				<li>If a student has a difficult time with a particular movement, have the student practice the skill or each movement separately before putting it all together. Students may need feedback and repetition for new skills and more difficult movements.</li>
				<li>Provide the student with verbal prompts or audio prompt (clapping, whistles, music or other sound source) to help the student keep oriented during movement activities. Fade assistance as the student becomes more comfortable and and increase independent.</li>

For Students who are Blind or Visually Impaired
 

Music class is a preferred activity for many students who are blind and visually impaired, but it shouldn't be assumed that all students that are blind will be musicians or be uniquely gifted in this area. Like other areas of the curriculum, adaptations may be necessary to allow the student who is blind or visually impaired to fully participate.
Many aspects of the music program will be the same for students who are sighted and students who are blind or visually impaired. There are some strategies that will help students access the curriculum. 

Students should be exposed to a variety of musical instruments from a young age. Show students the different ways that music can be produced. Listening to the differences in sounds will help the student develop auditory discrimination skills. Expose the student to a variety of types of music (ex. concerts, CD's, YouTube videos, etc.) to help develop music appreciation. 

The Teacher of Students with Visual Impairments (TVI) and the general education music teacher should collaborate, at a very minimum at the beginning of the school year, to review activities and lessons that will be taught throughout the year. If the student will need to read music, it may be necessary to provide enlarged music scores or instruct a student who is blind in the braille music code if the student is a braille reader. Even if the student is using the braille music code, they should be familiarized with print symbols that are used (using tactual graphics) so they can understand terms and descriptions used by their sighted peers. Also, it may be necessary to determine if there is a need for non-visual prompts during conducting.

To help a student practice their scales or other music at home, YouTube videos can be a great resource. Collaborate with the music instructor to ensure that the correct version of the song or the correct scale is available. Copy and send the link home to the family to allow the student to listen and practice at home.

<br>
 
<b><center>Braille Music Code</center></b>
<ul>
<li>
Braille music is a form of the six dot braille code used in literary braille. The code includes all the information presented on a standard sheet of a music score including notes and their values, dynamic, expression marks, and fingering. Braille music score is presented in a linear form. In teaching a piano score, the score for the one hand is presented followed by the score for the other hand. Once the student has learned each score, they then play with both hands together. For this reason, it will take longer for a student to learn printed music scores than sighted students. Students must learn to memorize music in order to perform it as sight reading music is not possible with the braille music code as the student will need to read the score tactually instead of visually.
</li> <br><li>
The music braille code is used internationally. Copies of the music code are available for purchase in hardcopy print and braille from theAPH or can be downloaded from BANA.
</li><br><li>
BRL.org offers a very detailed braille music code manual. 
</li><br><li>
Dancing Dots offers technology, educational resources and training to assist blind and low vision individuals to read, write, and record their music. Their products and services foster inclusion, literacy and independence for visually impaired musicians and audio producers engaged in educational, leisure, and professional pursuits.
 </li><br><li>
How to Read Braille Music by Bettye Krolick provides the basics in clear terms with an emphasis on accessibility. The examples are short, fun and to the point. The book identifies music symbols frequently encountered in elementary to intermediate music with an index for identifying new symbols as they are found. View the pages for free on the internet archive!
 </li><br><li>
Opus Technologies offers software, print, and braille materials for learning and using braille, especially braille music. Products include books and software for music braille, and popular braille sheet music.

        <center><caption> DRAMATIC PLAY STATION</caption></center>
 


The dramatic play station provides opportunities for social, language, emotional, and intellectual development. Students have the opportunity to interact with peers in social situation and practice language.
<br>
The ability to pretend and to experiment with playthings is necessary for the development of language, reasoning and imagination for sighted and visually impaired students. Through play in the dramatic play station, the students have opportunities to develop an understanding of roles of family members, learn about community helpers and experiment with relationships.
<br>
Keep in mind that it is especially difficult for students with visual impairments to understand the difference between make-believe and reality. In order to imitate and act out experiences, a student must first have had experiences with and understanding of the roles and actions to be acted out. It is more meaningful to re-enact familiar and real experiences in dramatic play areas. Students with visual impairments need concrete experiences in real-life situations followed by play repetitions.  For this reason, it would be beneficial to begin a unit with a trip to a bakery, farm, restaurant, etc. before expecting the student to pretend with the materials. 
<br>Incorporate concepts into the drama station by discussing: likes and differences of pots & pans, silverware, clothing; size (big/little and small/medium/large) and quantity differences of people, clothes, food containers; placing spoon/utensils in and out of a pot or oven; placing dolls on top of the bed or underneath the sheets; placing pots on top of a hot pad or placing the hot pad underneath the pot; sound differences of pots and pans rattling; Match towels of the same texture; Discuss if food containers are hard or soft; if clothes are rough or smooth; front and back of food boxes; shapes of boxes and containers; and if boxes or cupboards being empty or full. Include clothing with various fasteners to encourage students to practice dressing skills.
<br>Use a real mailbox to “mail letters” and “deliver” the letters to the right person. Provide household items that can be used in different ways such as pots and pans that fit inside each other, and lids that fit on top. Incorporate objects/materials within the center to make the experiences more meaningful.  (ex. a real metal pan with a lid will be more meaningful than a plastic one, broom, iron/ironing board, phone, suitcases, keys and keyholes, dishes, etc.)  As the student forms more of an understanding of these real objects, you could introduce pretend and talk about similarities and differences.  (Keep in mind that pretend objects often lack interesting textures and smells and may always be too abstract for the visually impaired child!
<br>Materials to Incorporate Into Dramatic Play:
<br>When planning the dramatic play area, keep in mind that it needs to be a bigger area to accommodate the various furnishings and activities. It is also a loud area, so it is best to have it located near the block center which is another loud area. Create theme boxes using plastic totes or banker boxes. Store theme related materials in the boxes for easy retrieval. Supplement the theme boxes with freebies from business offices, doctor's offices, grocery stores, restaurants, dentists office, post office, etc. Parents may have access to materials for the boxes based on their jobs.

           Blind cricket was invented in Melbourne in 1922. The world's first sports ground and clubhouse for blind people was developed at Kooyong, Melbourne in 1928 and is still used today as the home of the VBCA.
		   <p>"In terms of playing equipment, the major adaptation is the cricket ball, which is significantly larger than a standard cricket ball and filled with ball bearings."</p>
		   
		<li>Cricket for the blind has also been played since the early 1920s in the United Kingdom. The founding members of the British Blind Sport organization were cricketers, and the association is the administrative body for the sport within the United Kingdom.
All players are registered blind or partially sighted, and of the eleven players in the team, at least four must be totally blind.
Many clubs play friendly matches against sighted teams and give demonstrations of the game during the lunch intervals of Test Cricket Matches.
</li><br>
<b>The rules of blind cricket are based on the standard laws of cricket with a few modifications.</b><br>
		<br><li>Teams are composed of players from up to five different sight categories B1, low partial, B2, B3 and B4. B1 is totally blind and the sight categories then move upwards in levels of sight. Each sight category is subject to different rules and compensations in order to make the playing field as level as possible.</li>
		<li>The pitch is made of concrete and measures the same length and width as used in sighted cricket. The boundaries are measured 40 meters in a circle around the pitch and indicated by a white line with flags set at intervals.</li>
		<li>In terms of playing equipment, the major adaptation is the cricket ball, which is significantly larger than a standard cricket ball and filled with ball bearings. The size allows partially sighted players to see the ball and the contents allow blind players to hear it. The wicket (stumps) is also larger, to allow partially sighted players to see and blind players to touch it in order to correctly orient themselves when batting or bowling.</li>
		<li>Verbal signals are widely used both by umpires and players: in particular, the bowler must shout 'Play!' as he releases the ball. The delivery is required to pitch at least twice when bowled to a completely blind batsman (once when bowled to a partially sighted batsman), but must not be rolling. Totally blind batsmen cannot be out stumped, and must be found to be LBW twice before going out. Totally blind fielders are allowed to take a catch on the bounce.</li>

           <center><b> PHYSICAL EDUCATION ADAPTATIONS</b></center><br>
<center><img src="images/chess.JPG" width="15%"></center>
Physical education is important for all students including those who are blind or visually impaired. Although planning will be necessary, it is important to include students in the physical education program as it is a required component of the standard curriculum.
<br>As with other students, students with visual impairments need to be actively involved in physical education programs that teach life long skills to maintain their health. In order to make the program accessible to students, there are adaptations and specialized equipment that may need to be employed to ensure that the student can fully access the physical education program. Prior to determining appropriate adaptations, it is important to first understand the students functional vision. The Teacher of Students with Visual Impairments will provide information for the team members and P.E. teacher on each students unique visual needs. One rule of thumb for all students with any visual impairment is to keep the instructional area as uncluttered as possible.

<br>The instruction of recreation skills should be planned and deliberately taught, and should focus on the development of life long skills. Often students who are visually impaired do not experience the same opportunities for recreation that students with no vision loss have in the early years.  Recreational and leisure activities can provide an avenue for the development of motor skills, social skills, language skills, and fitness.  It is important to expose the students to as many age-appropriate recreational activities as possible.  This will best prepare the student for future inclusion and independence.  

<br>Support the inclusion of students with visual impairments in group activities. Be sure that students play and talk with classmates rather than sit on the sidelines. Describe choices of activities that are available at recess. During games, allow students to buddy-up with a sighted partner. Remember that students who are visually impaired need support from staff during periods of free play on the playground. The visually impaired student should be able to participate in most recreational activities except for those that require good visual acuity (i.e. dodge ball). Build a student’s self-confidence by letting him/her try.  Take the student through an activity or game a couple of times before requiring independent movement.  For a sighted student, motor imitation is a visual skill; a student who is visually impaired needs to experience the activity physically.
<br>
<br><caption>Team Sports</caption><br>
With some accommodations, a student with a visual impairment can participate in team sports. Possible auditory accommodations for physical education include beeping balls or balls with bells, beeping goal posts, rice in a beach ball or volleyball a sound source (beeps or plays music), beeping bases or radios to locate targets. Possible visual accommodations include brightly colored balls or those that offer a high contrast to their surroundings. Bright pylons beside bases and padded and brightly colored goalposts. Fluorescent tape can be used to mark boundaries in the gym and outdoors.
<br><b><caption>Running</caption></b><br>
A guide can be used to run with the student in order to encourage participation and foster social exchanges. However, to promote independence and encourage running, use guide wire system or rope that is securely anchored to an eyehook or attached to poles. Attach a PVC tube to the rope/wire so the student can hold the tube and run along the rope. This allows the student to run freely and not be dependent on a sighted guide. Running in on an open field with no assistance is an option if you use a portable sound source. The student can be encouraged to run toward the sound source. An indoor option that can lead to greater independence and lifelong fitness is to provide the student with a treadmill.

<br>
<caption>Bowling</caption>
Students can learn basic bowling skills by playing with home-made or purchased bowling sets that can be used at home and school. A sound source can be placed behind the pins in order to provide an auditory target for the students. Many bowling alleys will provide bumpers, or portable bowling rails, upon request.

            There are relatively easy adaptations to the creative art program in order to make it accessible to students who are blind or visually impaired. While younger students typically participate in creative art within the classroom, most school age students take advantage of this time for an inclusive opportunity with typically developing peers. 
Whether art activities take place in your classroom, or in the art room, the creative art area is a place where students can explore a variety of interesting materials. If you have creative art activities within your room, incorporate materials to make the activities more tactual. Add scents and textures to dough and paints. It provides them with a means of self expression and originality. Students can explore a variety of materials, textures and colors, and develop fine motor skills. You can make this time more meaningful to the student who has low vision or is blind by adding scents and textures and using a variety of dimensional materials.<br>
<br><b>Adaptations for Students with Low Vision</b><br>
<li> 
For students with low vision, present materials on trays of contrasting color and use materials that have good contrast in general. Use high contrast materials. Highlight outlines of pictures with a black felt tip pen, or color it is supposed to be colored. You may also want to help the student trace the outline and locate important features in the project.  When gluing objects on paper, such as the triangle eyes of a jack-o-lantern, it may be helpful to show the student a finished model first, so that the student can see the end result.  Encourage students to use their low vision devices to identify color words on crayons/markers and on worksheets.
</li>
<br><b>Adaptations for Students with Minimal Vision</b><br>
<li> 
For students with minimal vision, initially help the student understand the representation of the picture or project, and the location of materials, by helping her to“look” with their hands and fingers. Guide the student’s hands to locate the “landmarks” with verbally associated descriptors. If the student needs to color an area, place the paper on top of a mesh screening or sandpaper so they get a tactual feedback when they color. You will also want to create a tactual outline or border of the area they need to color in. There are a number of ways to create a tactual border. You can use dimensional glue or paint, a glue gun, wikki sticks or a sewing pattern wheel poked from the underside to provide tactual information of lines. You will also want to provide indicators for where to apply glue, shapes or materials. 
</li>
<br><b>Art to Develop Cognitive Skills</b><br>
<li>The creative art area is another station that lends itself well to teaching concepts. Discuss likes and differences in textures and looks of art materials available; Discuss placing materials in and out of paint, glue, etc.; Discuss how thick and thin material is; Match art materials of the same texture; Discuss if art materials are hard or soft; Discuss if materials are rough or smooth; Discuss shapes of materials; and Discuss paint jars or glue bottles as being empty or full.
